Make sure to install all dependencies as they are enumerated in the package.json. This can be accomplished with an npm install. To test the functionality you can use Insomnia to make the API requests.

## Usage Information

For now this is just a demonstration of backend functionality. It can be interfaced with by running node index.js in the root directory to run the sever locally. Later on we can look at deploying this to the web.
